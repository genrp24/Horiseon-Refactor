# Horiseon Refactor

## Description

This project was started to refactor the existing code to make it more readable and so that the webpage meets all accessibility standards. I also went in to the CSS style sheet and consolidated any code that was repetative. I learned that there is always room to make webpages more accessible so that they are optimized for search engines.
